            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Adobe Illustrator, part of the Adobe Creative Suite package, is a powerful application used to create and edit vector graphics. This extremely popular application is a considered an industry standard, and is used widely by graphic designers to create logos, illustrations, and artwork for signs, posters, packaging and many other printed products. Adobe Illustrator can also be used to create illustrative web graphics.</p>

            <h1>The Illustrator Interface</h1>

            <p>This section provides a brief overview of the Illustrator interface and describes its commonly-used components.</p>

            <h2>Interface Overview</h2>

            <p>The portion of the Illustrator interface that is used to view and edit documents is known as the Workspace. A wide variety of windows, tools and menus (known as Panels) can be displayed within the Workspace in order to provide quick access to the feaures needed for a given task.</p>

            <h3>Creating a New Document</h3>

            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p>Open the Illustrator application.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Go to <strong>File > New</strong></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>In the New Document window, adjust the settings to those shown below and Click OK.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <img class="center full-width" src="images/interface-newdocument.png" alt="The New Document settings dialog box">

            <h2>Interface Components</h2>

            <img class="center full-width" src="images/interface-components.png" alt="Diagram of the Illustrator interface, showing the Tools panel on the left, Control panel along the top, the Panels dock on the right and the Status Bar along the bottom">

            <h3>Application Bar</h3>

            <p>The Application Bar contains the Workspace Switcher menu and a shortcut to Adobe Bridge and Adobe Stock. On Windows machines, the Application Bar also contains the File, Edit, View, etc menus. The Workspace Switcher menu can be used to arrange multiple windows. Use the drop-down menu to choose one of the many available window layout options.</p>

            <h3>Document Window</h3>

            <p>The Document Window displays the file that you are currently working on. If you have multiple files open, each file appears as a tab in the Document Window, as shown above. The white rectangle inside the Document Window, which displays the printable area of the Workspace, is called the Artboard.</p>

            <h3>Tools panel</h3>

            <p>The Tools Panel contains tools used to create and manipulate artwork (like a toolbox). To select a tool, simply click it. Tools with a triangle in the lower-right corner have additional tools hidden beneath them. To display hidden tools, click and hold a tool icon; a drop-down menu showing the hidden tools will appear.</p>

            <img class="center" src="images/interface-toolspanel.png" alt="The tools panel showing the various tool options that can be hidden under a given tool icon and revealed by clicking and holding">

            <h3>Control panel</h3>

            <p>The Control Bar displays options for the currently selected tool. Control Bar options are generally a small subset of those available in other panels and menus. Keep in mind that there may be additional options for your selected tool beyond those displayed in the Control Bar.</p>
                    <div class="important center">
            <h2>Control Panel Not Appearing?</h2>
            <p>As of Illustrator 2018, the <strong>Control Panel is off by default</strong>.</p>
            <p> To enable this feature for easier access to alignment and fill/stroke tools, go to <strong class="highlight">Window > Control</strong></p>
        </div>


            <h3>Panels dock</h3>

            <p>Panels are menus that allow you to monitor and modify your artwork. By default, all Panels are closed and hidden beneath icons in the Panel Dock. Icons in the Panel Dock represent groups of related Panels; to open a Panel Group, click an icon in the Panel Dock.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Each Panel within a Panel Group is displayed on a separate tab. To bring a Panel to the front of the group, click its tab.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>To close a Panel group, click the double arrows in the upper-right corner of the Panel Group.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Panels can also be displayed individually. To show a panel, go to the Window menu and Click its name. To hide the panel, go to the Window menu and Click the panel name again.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Working with Shapes</h1>

            <p>Illustrator provides several shape tools that are used to draw pre-defined shapes. In this section of the class, we’ll experiment with some basic ways to use the Shape Tools and explain the distinction between Selection Tool and Direct Selection Tool in Illustrator.</p>

            <h2>Using Shape Tools</h2>

            <ul>


                <li>
                    <p>In the Tools Panel, Click the Rectangle Tool to select it.</p>
                </li>
                <div class="reference">
                    <img src="images/icon-rectangle.png" alt="Icon for rectangle tool">
                    <h3>Rectangle Tool</h3>
                    <p>Use the Rectangle tool to draw rectangles and squares.</p>
                    <p>Hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key to draw a perfect Square.</p>
                    <p>Hold the <kbd>Alt/option</kbd> key to draw the shape from the center out (rather than from one corner to the other)</p>
                    <p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> <kbd>M</kbd></p>

                </div>

                <li>
                    <p>Click and Drag on the Artboard to create a rectangle. Notice that, by default, Illustrator starts drawing the shape from a corner. To draw from the center instead, hold the Option key while dragging.</p>
                </li>

                <img class="center border" src="images/shapes-usingtool-01.png" alt="Screenshot of the rectangle tool being dragged out to create a shape">

                <li>
                    <p>To draw a perfect square: hold the Shift key, then Click and Drag on the Artboard. This technique works to create symmetrical shapes with other shape tools as well.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>To create a shape with specified dimensions: select Rectangle Tool and Click once on the Artboard. In the window that opens, Type “2 in” in the Width field and “1 in” in the Height field, then Click OK. This creates a rectangle 2 inches wide by 1 inch high. Dimensions can also be specified using other units, such as pixels (px) or points (pt).</p>
                </li>

                <img class="center" src="images/shapes-usingtool-02.png" alt="Screenshot showing the dialog box for creating a rectangle of a specific size">

                <li>
                    <p>To draw other pre-defined shapes: Click and Hold the Rectangle Tool in the Tools Panel to display hidden tools. Practice drawing other shapes with above methods.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Resizing Shapes</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Select the shape with Selection Tool, then hover mouse over Control Points (until double straight arrow appears) Click and Drag the mouse to resize shape (hold the Shift key to constrain proportion).</p>
                </li>

                <img class="center" src="images/shapes-resize-01.png" alt="Screenshot showing the drag handles on a rectangle shape">

                <img class="float-right" src="images/icon-resize.png" alt="Icon for the Scale tool">

                <li>
                    <p>Another method to resize shapes: Select the shape with Selection Tool. Double Click the Scale Tool in the Tools Panel. To resize shape larger than origianl, enter value greater than 100; and less than 100 to make shape smaller than original (keep original proportion by selecting uniform).</p>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Copying & Pasting Shapes</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Using the Selection Tool, Click on an object you want to duplicate.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>To Copy the object go to (<strong>Edit > Copy</strong> or <kbd>Ctrl/Command</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>)</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>To Paste it (<strong>Edit > Paste</strong> or <kbd>Ctrl/Command</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>).</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rotating Shapes</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Select the shape with Selection Tool, then hover mouse over Control Points (until double ben arrow appears) Click and Drag the mouse to rotate shape. </p>
                </li>

                <img class="center" src="images/shapes-rotate-01.png" alt="Screenshot showing how to rotate an image via the Rotate tool">

                <img class="float-right" src="images/icon-rotate.png" alt="Icon for the Rotate tool">

                <li>
                    <p>Another method to rotate shapes: Select the shape with Selection Tool. Double Click the Rotate Tool in the Tools Panel. You can either enter an exact value or drag the desired rotation angle on the circle.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Deleting Shapes</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Removing individual shape: Click the shape with Selection Tool and Press <kbd>Delete</kbd>.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Removing multiple shapes at once: Use the Selection Tool, Click while holding down Shift key on each shape and Press <kbd>Delete</kbd>.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>With the Selection Tool, Click and Drag a box around all of the shapes that you just drew. This technique, sometimes called “rubber banding,” selects all of the objects in a given area of the document. Press <kbd>Delete</kbd> to remove the shapes.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Adding Color to Shapes</h2>

            <p>By default, Illustrator applies a black stroke and white fill. Stroke is the outline around the edge of a shape and Fill is the shading inside a shape. There are several ways to specify colors in Illustrator; other methods will be introduced later in the class.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Click the Selection Tool, then Click the star shape to select it. In the Control Panel, Click the Dropdown arrow to apply a color to the fill.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Since we do not want a stroke on the star, find the stroke swatch Dropdown and Click the white square with a red slash through it, which means no color.</p>

        <h2>Grouping Shapes</h2>

        <p>When we create a complex shape from multiple simple shapes, it’s helpful to be able to move and resize all the shapes as one object. In Illustrator, we can do this using the Group function.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <li>
                <p>Using the Selection Tool, Click and Drag a box around your star icon. This selects all of the shapes at once.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>In the Object menu at the top of the window, Click Group.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Now when you click on the star it will also select all the shapes that makes up the icon. (To ungroup the object go to <strong>Object > Ungroup</strong>).</p>

    <h1>Drawing with the Pen Tool</h1>

    <p>In Illustrator, the Pen Tool is used to draw custom shapes from scratch by laying out a series of curve and corner points connected by paths. We’ll use this tool to draw the center vein of our leaf, but, since the Pen Tool is notoriously difficult to master, we’ll complete a few practice exercises first. </p>

These anennae are called “control handles,” and they are used to define the direction and size of curves. Though we won’t see a line appear until we create the next point, adding these control handles to our first point sets the stage for a curved line.</p>

    <h1>Creating an Icon from Scratch</h1>
    <p>We could draw our leaf outline by hand, but it’s much easier to achieve symmetrical, professional-looking shape by modifying a Shape Tool object. In this exercise, we’ll create our leaf shape by modifying a Shape Tool square.</p>

    <h2>Modifying Shape Paths</h2>

    <ol class="instruction-list">

        <li>
            <p>In the Tools Panel, Click and Hold the Ellipse Tool to reveal hidden tools, then Click the <strong>Rectangle Tool</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>With the Rectangle Tool selected, Hold the Shift Key, then Click and Drag on the Artboard to create a square. In the example file, the square was about .75 in.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Now, we’ll rotate the square 45 degrees either with the Rotate Tool or with the Selection Tool Click the square and Hover just outside the edge of the square until you see a double-ended, curved arrow.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>With the double-ended, curved arrow showing, hold the Shift (this limit the rotation to 45 degree increments), then Click and Drag to rotate the square 45 ̊</p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images/leaf-modify-01.png" alt="Rotating a square shape 45 degrees clockwise">


        <li>
            <p>Next, we’ll begin altering the shape to turn it into a leaf. In Illustrator, every shape is made up of points connected by paths; we can change a shape by modifying the individual points that define it. In the Tools Panel, Click the <strong>Direct Select</strong> Tool, then Click and Drag the left-most point of the diamond inward slightly. Repeat for the right-most point so the shape becomes more diamond-like.</p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images/leaf-modify-02.png" alt="Moving one of the anchor points inwards to create a narrow vertical diamond shape">

        <li>
            <p>Currently, the left and right points of our diamond are sharp corners - not very leaf- like! Fortunately, we can change any corner point to a curved point using the Convert Anchor Point Tool. In the Tools Panel, Click and Hold the Pen Tool to reveal hidden tools, then Click the Convert Anchor Point Tool.</p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images/leaf-modify-04.png" alt="The Anchor Point tool">

        <img class="float-right" src="images/icon-anchorpoint.png" alt="The Icon for the Anchor point tool">

        <li>
            <p>With the Convert Anchor Point Tool selected, Click the left-most point of the diamond and begin dragging upward so that a set of Control Handles appear. After you start dragging, hold the Shift key to keep the Control Handles at a 90 degree angle.</p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images/leaf-modify-05.png" alt="The left anchor point converted to a curved point, rather than a corner, creating a smooth curve">

        <li>
            <p>Repeat for the right-most point, but Drag downward with the Convert Anchor Point Tool, doing your best to match the curve on the left side.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Once the curves have been created, you can use the Direct Selection Tool to adjust them by dragging the Control Handles.</p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images/leaf-modify-07.png" alt="The right side of the diamond now curved as well">
    </ol>
<img class="center border" src="images/convert-anchor.gif" alt="GIF showing how to convert anchor points into curves using the Convert Anchor Point tool">
    <h2>Drawing the Midrib</h2>

    <p>We’ll use the Pen Tool to add the center vein to the leaf.</p>

    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li>
            <p>Let’s lock our leaf shape so that we can draw on top of it without changing it. Using the Selection Tool, select the leaf shape, then, in the top menu bar, choose <strong>Object > Lock > Selection</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>In the Tools Panel, Click the Pen Tool to select it (it may be hidden beneath another tool; if so, Click and Hold to display hidden tools).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Set the Stroke to none and the Fill to a color other than black, so that you can see it easily.</p>
        </li>

        <img class="float-right" src="images/icon-pen.png" alt="Icon for the Pen tool">

        <li>
            <p>Using the Pen Tool, Click three times over the lower half of the leaf shape to create the vertices of a narrow triangle. Illustator automatically connects these points with paths. To close the shape, Hover over the first point until you see a tiny circle next to your cursor, then Click your first point.</p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images/leaf-midrib-01.png" alt="A triangle shape drawn over the middle of the leaf shape, to create the beginning of a stem">

        <img class="float-right" src="images/icon-anchorpoint.png" alt="Icon for the Anchor Point tool">

        <li>
            <p>In the Tools Panel, Select the Convert Anchor Point Tool and use it on the bottom points of the triangle to curve the shape slightly. Don’t worry about how the bottom edge of the triangle looks – this portion will not be part of the finished shape.</p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images/leaf-midrib-02.png" alt="The stem is curved along the bottom">

        <li>
            <p>Adjust the Anchor Points and Control Handles using the Direct Selection Tool until you’re satisfied with the shape.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
<img class="center border" src="images/create-stem.gif" alt="Using the Convert Anchor Point and Direct Select tools to curve the stem of our leaf icon">
    <h2>Subtracting Shapes with Pathfinder</h2>

    <p>We’ll again use Pathfinder functions to cut the center vein shape out of the leaf shape.</p>

    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li>
            <p>With the Selection Tool, Select both the leaf and the vein shape.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Before we can work with the leaf shape, we need to unlock it. In the top menu bar, Choose <strong>Object > Unlock All</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Open the Pathfinder Menu (<strong>Window > Pathfinder</strong>).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Under Shape Modes, Click the second icon, Minus Front. When used on two stacked shapes, this mode cuts the top shape out of the bottom shape.</p>
        </li>

    <h1>Gradients</h1>

    <p>In this section, choose one of the icons from the previous exercises to create a finished logo by adding a background gradient and drop shadow effects.</p>

    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li>
            <p>First, we will create a background shape for our icon. To do this, Select a shape tool from the tools panel (Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, or Ellipse) and Set the fill to a color other than white.</p>

                    <p>Double-Click the white color swatch on the Gradient Slider and repeat steps 3-4 to edit it. Our goal is to create a subtle color change, so make the second color similar to the first color, but slightly lighter (hint: start with the same swatch as the first color).</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Back in the Gradient Panel, we’ll add one more color to our gradient - another instance of the first color. To do this, Move the lighter color to the center of the slider, then Click the darker color. Hold the Option/Alt key and Drag it all the way to the left.</p>
                </li>

            <p>To finish, we’ll change the icon color from black to white. If you chose the star or the leaf, Select the the icon using the Selection Tool and Change the Fill to white. If you chose the Atom, the filled and unfilled shapes must be changed separately. With the Direct Selection Tool, Select the three unfilled ellipses (Hold the Shift key to select multiple objects at once), then Change the Stroke Color to white. Repeat for the filled ellipses, changing the Fill Color from black to white.</p>

    <h1>Saving/Exporting Final Artwork</h1>

    <p>When saving or exporting from Illustrator, it’s important to choose file formats and settings that are appropriate for the intended use of your artwork. In this section, we’ll learn to save artwork properly for print and web applications.</p>

    <h2>Saving for Print</h2>

    <p>You can print Illustrator files from the computer that you created them on without issue, however, if you are printing files from another computer or sending them to a print shop, there are a few points to note:</p>

    <h3>Color Space</h3>

    <p>For printing, Illustrator files should be in CMYK color mode. Using the Print Preset when creating a new document sets the color mode to CMYK. To verify that your document is in CMYK mode:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>In the top menu bar, Choose <strong>File > Document Color Mode</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Make sure that CMYK is selected.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Fonts</h3>

    <p>Fonts are stored on individual computers - there’s no guarantee that another computer or a print shop will have the font(s) you used in your document. To ensure that your type shows up as planned, it’s a good idea to convert your type to outlines. This means changing your type from live, editable type to shapes that Illustrator treats just like any other shape object. To convert type to outlines:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Before outlining type, always Save a Copy of the file (<strong>File > Save a Copy</strong>).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Make sure that all objects and layers are unlocked, then select everything in your document (<strong>Edit > Select All</strong> or <kbd>Ctrl/Command</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>In the top menu bar, Choose <strong>Type > Create Outlines</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>DO NOT save outlined type in your original document - you won’t be able to edit it!</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Links</h3>

    <p>Though we did not cover placing images into Illustrator files, you’ll likely encounter this feature as you work further in Illustrator. When images are placed into Illustrator documents, they are not embedded into the file; instead, a reference (link) to an external file is created. In order to print files with linked images, the external image files must be available. To avoid missing images, do one of the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Place all of your linked files into one folder and supply this to your printer, along with your document file.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Embed your linked files into the document:</p>
        </li>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the top menu bar, Choose Window > Links to open the Links Panel</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Select all of the files in the Links Panel, then Click the Menu Icon and Click Embed Image.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <li>
            <p>Save your document as a PDF (see instructions below); linked files will automatically be embedded into the PDF.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>File Format</h3>

    <p>Most print shopes use Adobe Creative Suite software, but they may not have the same version that you used to create your document. To avoid file format problems, it’s a good idea to save your final document in a universal format, such as PDF. To save a PDF from Illustrator:</p>

    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li>
            <p>Outline your fonts first, following the directions above - fonts are not embedded in PDF documents.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>In the top menu bar, Choose <strong>File > Save As</strong></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>In the Save As window that opens, Choose Adobe PDF, then Click Save.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>In the Save Adobe PDF window that opens, Set the Adobe PDF Present field to <strong>High Quality Print</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Click <strong>Save PDF</strong>.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Saving for the Web</h2>

    <p>Images used on the Web must meet specific file format and size requirements. In order to use our banner graphic on a website, we’ll need to convert it to a different file format. This process is called image optimization.</p>

    <h3>Image Size/Resolution</h3>

    <p>Since image file sizes affect the amount of time it takes to load a web page into a browser, it’s important to keep file sizes as small as possible, while still maintaining reasonable quality.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Always set image resolutions to 72ppi (pixels per inch) - this is the default resolution of most device screens.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Always scale images to the exact size needed - if the space on your web page is 960px x 180px, your image should be 960px x 180px. While browsers can scale images to fit a particular space, this results in distortion and/or image files that are larger than necessary.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Web Image Formats</h3>

    <p>Web browsers are only able to display a few types of images, therefore, we often need to convert original images into a web-friendly format. Different formats are used for different types of images:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> Format </th>
            <th> Characteristics </th>
            <th> Best for </th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td> GIF </td>
            <td> Great at compressing flat color, but can only display 256 colors. Can display simple on/off transparency. </td>
            <td> Illustrations/text with flat colors, and animation</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td> JPEG </td>
            <td> Can display millions of colors; smaller file size than PNG-24 </td>
            <td> Photographs, graded colors (ie: gradients) </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td> PNG-8 </td>
            <td> Great at compressing flat color, but can only display 256 colors. Can display simple on/off transparency. (similar to GIF) </td>
            <td> Illustrations/text with flat colors </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td> PNG-24 </td>
            <td> Able to display partial transparency (shadows, etc) </td>
            <td> Illustrations with more complex colors, screenshots, and non-photograph images </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>

    <p>Fortunately, Illustrator includes features that make it easy to optimize web graphics.</p>

    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li>
            <p>In the top menu bar, Choose <strong>File > Export > Save for Web</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Illustrator attempts to choose the file format and settings that are best for the artwork in your document. As noted in the table above, GIF and PNG files are generally best for illustrative art.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>In this case, Illustrator chose GIF. Click Save.</p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images/save-web.png" alt="The Save For Web dialog box.">

        <li>
            <p>In the Save window that opens, Change the file name to logo-web.gif and Navigate to your class files folder.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Click Save to create a copy of your logo for web in GIF </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
