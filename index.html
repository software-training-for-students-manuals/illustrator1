        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Adobe Illustrator, part of the Adobe Creative Suite package, it is a powerful application used to create and
            edit vector graphics. This extremely popular application is a considered an industry standard, and is used
            widely by graphic designers to create logos, illustrations, and artwork for signs, posters, packaging and
            many other printed products. Adobe Illustrator can also be used to create illustrative web graphics.</p>

        <h2>About this Class</h2>

        <p>This manual provides a basic introduction to the Illustrator interface and explores commonly used features by
            guiding students through various exercises and applying those skills and tools in creating an e-card. During
            this class, students will:</p>

        <h1>The Illustrator Interface</h1>

        <p>This section provides a brief overview of the Illustrator interface and describes its commonly-used
            components.</p>

        <h2>Interface Overview</h2>

        <p>The portion of the Illustrator interface that is used to view and edit documents is known as the Workspace. A
            wide variety of windows, tools and menus (known as Panels) can be displayed within the Workspace in order to
            provide quick access to the feaures needed for a given task.</p>

        <h3>Creating a New Document</h3>

        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Open the Illustrator application.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Click <strong>Create New</strong></p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>In the New Document window, adjust the settings to those shown below and click Create.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <img class="center" src="images2/document-settings.png"
            alt="Document settings: Unit=Pixels, Orientation=Portrait, Artboards=1, Width=800px, Height=1080px, Color Mode=RGB, Raster Effects= High(300ppi)">


        <h2>Interface Components</h2>

        <img class="center full-width" src="practiceimages/illustrator-interface.png"
            alt="Diagram of the Illustrator interface, showing the Tools panel on the left, Control panel along the top, and the Properties Panel">

        <h3>Application Bar</h3>

        <p>The Application Bar contains the Workspace Switcher menu and a shortcut to Adobe Bridge and Adobe Stock. The
            Application Bar also contains the File, Edit, View, etc menus.</p>

        <p>The Workspace Switcher menu can be used to arrange multiple windows. Depending on your project, there are a
            variety of window layout options that will suit your needs. Use the drop-down menu to choose one of the many
            available window layout options. For the rest of this tutorial, we will be using the
            <strong>Essensials</strong> workspace.</p>

        <h3>Document Window</h3>

        <p>The Document Window displays the file that you are currently working on. If you have multiple files open,
            each file appears as a tab in the Document Window, as shown above. The white rectangle inside the Document
            Window, which displays the printable area of the Workspace, is called the Artboard.</p>

        <h3>Tools Panel</h3>

        <p>The Tools Panel contains tools used to create and manipulate artwork (like a toolbox). To select a tool,
            simply click it. Tools with a triangle in the lower-right corner have additional tools hidden beneath them.
            To display hidden tools, click and hold a tool icon; a drop-down menu showing the hidden tools will appear.
        </p>

            alt="The tools panel showing the various tool options that can be hidden under a given tool icon and revealed by clicking and holding">
            alt="The tools panel showing the various tool options that can be hidden under a given tool icon and revealed by clicking and holding">

        <h3>Control Panel</h3>

        <p>The Control Panel displays options for the currently selected tool. Control Panel options are generally a
            small subset of those available in other panels and menus. Keep in mind that there may be additional options
            for your selected tool beyond those displayed in the Control Panel.</p>
        <div class="important center">
            <h2>Control Panel Not Appearing?</h2>
            <p>As of Illustrator 2020, the <strong>Control Panel is off by default</strong>.</p>
            <p> To enable this feature for easier access to alignment and fill/stroke tools, go to <strong
                    class="highlight">Window > Control</strong></p>
        </div>


        <h3>Properties Panel</h3>

        <p>The Properties Panel offers options to further monitor and modify your artwork, and some of these settings
            can also be found in the Control Panel. There are also two other panels: the Layers Panel and the Libraries
            Panel. We will delve more into the Layers Panel later in the workshop; however, you will not be using the
            Libraries Panel. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Each panel is displayed on a separate tab. To bring a Panel to the front, click its tab.</p>
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h1>Illustrator Practice Files</h1>

        <p>For the first half of the workshop, we will learn about the different tools available in Illustrator by
            working through different exercises.</p>

        <p>We will start by going to <strong class="highlight">Files > Open </strong> and then selecting <strong
                class="highlight">Illustrator-Practice-2020</strong></p>


        <h2>Layers Panel</h2>
        <p>In many of the Adobe Create Suite applications, documents are often organized and separated into different
            components called layers. You can edit and modify objects in each layer without affecting items in other
            layers. The Illustrator practice file has multiple layers, and throughout this exercise, we want to work
            within the 'Practice' layer in order to utilize the tools.</p>

        <p>Go to the <strong>Layers Panel</strong> and select the 'Practice' layer. </p>

        <img class="center" src="images2/layers-panel.png" alt="Practice layaer from the Layers Panel is selected">

        <div class="important center">
            <h2>Smart Guides</h2>
            <p>Before you begin, let's turn on <strong>Smart Guides.</strong> Smart Guides allow you to allign objects
                on your artboard easily, and it will greatly aid you on your projects.</p>
            <p> To enable this feature, go to the Application Bar and select <strong class="highlight"> View > Smart
                    Guides.</strong> </p>
            <img src="images2/smartguides.png"
                alt="After selecting Smart Guides, there is a checkmark next to it in the View dropdown panel">

        <h1>Navigating the Workspace</h1>

        <p>Working in Illustrator often involves moving around the workspace in order to focus on different portions of
            your project. In this section, we discuss a few methods of navigating the workspace.</p>


        <h2>Zoom Tool</h2>

                    from the center out by holding the <kbd>Alt/Option</kbd> key while dragging out. Combine both of

        <h1>Pen Tool</h1>

        <p>In Illustrator, the Pen Tool is used to draw custom shapes from scratch by laying out a series of curve
            and corner points connected by paths. We’ll complete a few practice exercises. </p>

        <h2>Exercise 1: Straight Lines</h2>

        <ol class="instruction-list">

                alt="The Fill is set to none and the Stroke Color is dark blue">

            <li>
                <p>Before you start drawing, make sure that the Stroke Color is set to a color that you can see
                    easily and that the Fill Color is set to none</p>
            </li>


            <li>
                <p>In the Tools Panel, select the <strong>Pen Tool.</strong></p>
            </li>

                <img src="images/icon-pen.png" alt="The Icon for the Pen tool">
                <h3>Pen Tool</h3>
                <p>The Pen tool is used to create anchor points and adjust the angles of the curves connecting them.
                </p>
                <p>Click once to create an anchor point. A line appears from the last anchor point you've placed,
                    connected to wherever your mouse cursor is on screen. Click again to create additional points. </p>
                <p>Click and drag to set the angle for the <em>control handle</em>, which affect the angle of lines
                    (also known as <em>paths</em>) that connect the anchor points.</p>
                <p>Click the first point you created to close your shape and stop adding new points.</p>
                <p>To stop creating new points without closing your shape, hit the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key or select
                    another tool.</p>
            </div>
            <li>
                <p>Click once in the center of point 1 to place your first anchor point. The Pen Tool creates paths
                    between multiple points, so we won’t see a line appear until we place the next point.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Click once on point 2 to place another anchor point. This time, a line should appear between
                    points 1 and 2.</p>

            <li>
                <p>For this exercise, we will be creating a curved line with handles. With the <strong>Pen
                        Tool</strong> still selected, click on point 1 and drag upwards toward the red circle and
                    release the mouse. Though we won’t see a line appear until we create the next point, adding
                    these handles to our first point sets the stage for a curved line.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Click in the center of point 2 and drag downwards toward the red circle. A curved path is created
                    between points 1 and 2. Note that if we dragged upwards at point 2, the curve would have formed
                    an S shape instead of a U shape.</p>

                <p>Since this is not a closed shape, we will need to press the Enter key in order to move on to
                    another task. Using the <strong>Direct Selection Tool</strong>, we can move the handles to
                    adjust the curves.</p>

        <h2>Exercise 3: Heart</h2>

        <p>The first two exercises covered the bare essentials of the Pen Tool; now, we will apply what we learned
            by drawing a heart! We will use this heart in the e-card later. Make sure that you are not still editing
            your curve from Exercise 2. Either press the Enter key or switch to the Selection tool, then back to the
            Pen tool. </p>

        <div class="reference">
            <img src="images/pathfinder-labels.png" alt="The Pathfinder Panel">
            <h3>Pathfinder</h3>
            <p>The Pathfinder Panel allows you to create more complex shapes by combining or subtracting two or more
                overlapping shapes. Access Pathfinder via <strong>Window > Pathfinder</strong></p>
            <p>Select two or more overlapping shapes and use the Shape Modes buttons in the Panel to combine them.
            </p>
            <p>The four modes are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unite: </strong> Combine two or more shapes into one, eliminating internal paths that
                    overlap. </li>
                <li><strong>Minus Front: </strong> Subtract the shape in front from the shape behind. </li>
                <li><strong>Intersect: </strong> Keep only the areas where both shapes overlap.</li>
                <li><strong>Exclude: </strong> Remove the areas where both shapes overlap. </li>

        <h1>Type Tool</h1>

        <p>The Type Tool is very similar to other programs that utilize text. We will look at how we can change the

        <h2>Moving Objects to Another Document</h2>
        <li>
            <p>We will now drag the heart we created from the practice files. Click on the Illustrator
                Practice Files tab, and within the Pen Tool Exercise, find the heart we created earlier.
                With the <strong>Selection Tool</strong>, click and hold while dragging the heart to the
                other tab. Release once a green plus sign appears on the Penguin E-Card document. Finally,
                position the heart on the belly. </p>
        </li>

        <h2>Removing Shapes with the Shape Builder Tool</h2>

        <p> For this part of the tutorial, we will add dimension to the penguin by creating shadows with the
            Shape Builder Tool. </p>

        <li>
            <p>First, we will add a shadow to the beak. Drag a rectangle to the halfway point of the ellipse
                then change the fill to black.
            </p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images2/beakshadow-1.png"
            alt="The rectangle meets the horizontal halfway point of the beak">

        <li>
            <p>In order to have a more shadow-like effect, go to the Properties Panel and lower the Opacity
                to a somewhere between 10-15%.</p>
        </li>

        <div class="two-up">
            <img class="center" src="images2/beakshadow-opacitysettings.png"
                alt="In the Properties Panel, the opacity is set to 13%">

            <img class="center" src="images2/beakshadow-2.png"
                alt="A gray rectangle is on top of the lower half of the beak">
        </div>

        <li>
            <p>In this case, we do not want to use the rubberband method to select the beak and the
                rectangle because it will also select the shapes behind it, so we will have to use a
                different method. Using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong> select the gray rectangle then
                hold Shift while clicking on the beak. Next, click on the <strong>Shape Builder
                    Tool</strong> in the Tools Panel. Hold down the <kbd> Alt/Option</kbd> key and click the
                gray area outside of the beak. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>In a similar fashion, we will add a shadow that covers half of the penguin. Drag a rectangle
                to the vertical halfway point of the penguin and change the Fill to black.</p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images2/bodyshadow-1.png"
            alt="The rectangle meets the vertical halfway point of the body">

        <li>
            <p>Go to the Properties Panel and lower the Opacity to a somewhere between 10-15%.</p>
        </li>

        <div class="two-up">

        </div>

        <li>
            <p>In order to get rid of the unnecessary gray area, first use the rubberband method to select
                all the shapes. Click on the <strong>Shape Builder Tool</strong> then hold the
                <kbd>Alt/Option</kbd> key and click the gray area outside of the penguin. </p>

        <h2>Grouping Objects</h2>
        <li>
            <p>Right now, all the parts of the penguin are individual pieces, but you can group these shapes
                together. This allows you to easily move and resize the penguin without having to use the
                rubberband method each time. First, select the penguin using the rubberband method then go
                to <strong>Object > Group.</strong> To ungroup the shapes, go to <strong>Object >
                    Ungroup.</strong></p>
        </li>

        <img class="center" src="images2/group.png" alt="A panel with the Group option selected">

        <h2>Creating A Background</h2>

        <li>
            <p>With the completed penguin, it is time to place a background. To start, select the
                <strong>Rectangle Tool</strong> and place your cursor at the corner of the document where
                the Smart Guides indicate the “Intersect” point. Drag a rectangle to the opposite corner.

            <p>In this tutorial we end up choosing a solid background, but you can choose between a solid
                and a gradient background. With the background shape selected, click the Gradient Fill
                (highlighted in green in the picture) from the Tools Panel under Fill/Stroke Color.</p>

        <h1>Saving/Exporting Final Artwork</h1>

        <p>When saving or exporting from Illustrator, it is important to choose file formats and settings
            that are appropriate for the intended use of your artwork. In this section, we’ll first save and
            export our e-card then we will learn more about how we can save artwork properly for print and
            web applications.</p>

        <h2>Saving/Exporting the Ecard</h2>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Go to <strong>File > Export > Export As...</strong></p>

            <li>
                <p>Change the file format to <strong>JPEG</strong> because it allows us to display millions
                    of colors. Choose your desired folder and click Export.</p>

                <p>From the JPEG menu, various options appear. You might notice that the color mode is set
                    to RGB. The RGB color mode is suitable for artwork that will be viewed on screens
                    because the colors will be vibrant on computer and phone screens. To preserve the quality of the image, set the quality to 10 and the select 300 ppi for the resolution. Keep the rest of the settings the same and click OK.</p>
            </li>

            <p>Congratuations on completing the penguin ecard! You can send it to your friends, family, or
                whoever you wish to send it to. The following section will explain how you can save other
                projects. </p>


        </ol>

        <h2>Saving for the Web</h2>

        <p>Images used on the Web must meet specific file format and size requirements. For example, in
            order to use a banner graphic on a website, we’ll need to convert it to a different file format.
            This process is called image optimization.</p>

        <h3>Image Size/Resolution</h3>

        <p>Since image file sizes affect the amount of time it takes to load a web page into a browser, it’s
            important to keep file sizes as small as possible, while still maintaining reasonable quality.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Always set image resolutions to 72ppi (pixels per inch) - this is the default resolution
                    of most device screens.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Always scale images to the exact size needed - if the space on your web page is 960px x
                    180px, your image should be 960px x 180px. While browsers can scale images to fit a
                    particular space, this results in distortion and/or image files that are larger than
                    necessary.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Web Image Formats</h3>

        <p>Web browsers are only able to display a few types of images, therefore, we often need to convert
            original images into a web-friendly format. Different formats are used for different types of
            images:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th> Format </th>
                <th> Characteristics </th>
                <th> Best for </th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> GIF </td>
                <td> Great at compressing flat color, but can only display 256 colors. Can display simple
                    on/off transparency. </td>
                <td> Illustrations/text with flat colors, and animation</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> JPEG </td>
                <td> Can display millions of colors; smaller file size than PNG-24 </td>
                <td> Photographs, graded colors (ie: gradients) </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> PNG-8 </td>
                <td> Great at compressing flat color, but can only display 256 colors. Can display simple
                    on/off transparency. (similar to GIF) </td>
                <td> Illustrations/text with flat colors </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> PNG-24 </td>
                <td> Able to display partial transparency (shadows, etc) </td>
                <td> Illustrations with more complex colors, screenshots, and non-photograph images </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>

        <p>Fortunately, Illustrator includes features that make it easy to optimize web graphics.</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>In the top menu bar, Choose <strong>File > Export > Save for Web</strong>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Illustrator attempts to choose the file format and settings that are best for the artwork
                    in your document. As noted in the table above, GIF and PNG files are generally best for
                    illustrative art.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>In the Save window that opens, Change the file name and save it to your desired folder.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Click Save </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Saving for Print</h2>

        <p>You can print Illustrator files from the computer that you created them on without issue,
            however, if you are printing files from another computer or sending them to a print shop, there
            are a few points to note:</p>

        <h3>Color Space</h3>

        <p>For printing, Illustrator files should be in CMYK color mode. Using the Print Preset when
            creating a new document sets the color mode to CMYK. To verify that your document is in CMYK
            mode:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the top menu bar, Choose <strong>File > Document Color Mode</strong>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Make sure that CMYK is selected.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Fonts</h3>

        <p>Fonts are stored on individual computers - there’s no guarantee that another computer or a print
            shop will have the font(s) you used in your document. To ensure that your type shows up as
            planned, it’s a good idea to convert your type to outlines. This means changing your type from
            live, editable type to shapes that Illustrator treats just like any other shape object. To
            convert type to outlines:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Before outlining type, always Save a Copy of the file (<strong>File > Save a
                        Copy</strong>).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Make sure that all objects and layers are unlocked, then select everything in your
                    document (<strong>Edit > Select All</strong> or <kbd>Ctrl/Command</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>).
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>In the top menu bar, Choose <strong>Type > Create Outlines</strong>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>DO NOT save outlined type in your original document - you won’t be able to edit it!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Links</h3>

        <p>Though we did not cover placing images into Illustrator files, you’ll likely encounter this
            feature as you work further in Illustrator. When images are placed into Illustrator documents,
            they are not embedded into the file; instead, a reference (link) to an external file is created.
            In order to print files with linked images, the external image files must be available. To avoid
            missing images, do one of the following:</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Place all of your linked files into one folder and supply this to your printer, along
                    with your document file.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Embed your linked files into the document:</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p>In the top menu bar, Choose Window > Links to open the Links Panel</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Select all of the files in the Links Panel, then Click the Menu Icon and Click Embed
                        Image.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <li>
                <p>Save your document as a PDF (see instructions below); linked files will automatically be
                    embedded into the PDF.</p>
            </li>

        <h3>File Format</h3>

        <p>Most print shopes use Adobe Creative Suite software, but they may not have the same version that
            you used to create your document. To avoid file format problems, it’s a good idea to save your
            final document in a universal format, such as PDF. To save a PDF from Illustrator:</p>

        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Outline your fonts first, following the directions above - fonts are not embedded in PDF
                    documents.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>In the top menu bar, Choose <strong>File > Save As</strong></p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>In the Save As window that opens, Choose Adobe PDF, then Click Save.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>In the Save Adobe PDF window that opens, Set the Adobe PDF Present field to <strong>High
                        Quality Print</strong>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Click <strong>Save PDF</strong>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
